def compute_similarity(documents):
"""
Computes the similarity between documents using the Vector Space Model
and Cosine Similarity.
Args:
documents: A list of strings, where each string is a document.
Returns:
A list of similarity scores between each document pair.

# 1. Text Preprocessing and Vectorization

"This document is the second document.",
"And this is the third one.",
"Is this the first document?"
